# Work Log

**Location**: `.pr/xxxxx/notes.md` where xxxxx is 5-digit PR number

**Content**: Document decisions, learnings, and context that cannot be found in commit history.

See `.claude/rules/work-notes.md` for detailed format and guidelines.

## Quick Summary

- Focus on **why** and **how**, not **what** (git log shows what changed)
- Record decisions, alternatives considered, problems solved, learnings
- Do not duplicate information from commit messages or git diff
- Use free-form markdown with timestamps for multiple sessions
- Not every PR needs extensive notes

## Temporary Files

For temporary files during processing (not permanent work logs), use `.tmp/` directory. See `.claude/rules/temporary-files.md`.
