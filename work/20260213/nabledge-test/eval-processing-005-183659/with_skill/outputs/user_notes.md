# User Notes

## Uncertainty
- The knowledge files mention "Mainクラス" (Main class) in the launch command example, but the specific Main class knowledge file is marked as "not yet created" in index.toon
- Actual Main class implementation details are not available in current knowledge coverage

## Needs Human Review
None

## Workarounds
- Used generic "java <Mainクラス>" in the command example instead of a specific Main class name
- Focused answer on the -requestPath argument format, which is well-documented in the request-path section

## Suggestions
- Create knowledge file for "メインクラス" (Main class) to provide complete batch launch instructions including:
  - Standard Main class name/location
  - Complete command-line example with actual Main class
  - JVM options commonly used for batch execution
  - Environment setup requirements
